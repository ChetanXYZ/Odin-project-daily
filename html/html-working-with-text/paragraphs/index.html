    <!-- We use <strong> tags to convey importance, urgency, or seriousness in our markup -->

    <p>Before entering, link read the warning at the entrance of the cave: <strong>Caution! Fire-breathing dragon
            ahead.</strong></p>

    <!-- We use <em> tags to emphasize markup and indicate verbal stress of a word or words -->

    <p>Further and further Link went into the cave with each step, it grew darker. This was a <em>very</em> deep cave
        indeed.</p>

    <p>As he traveled deeper into the cave, Link thought to himself, <i>I hope Princess Zelda is in here.</i></p>

    <p>Link finally reached Princess Zelda, but was met by a fire-breathing dragon! Luckily, Link had <b>The Master
            Sword</b> and used it to defeat the dragon and escape the cave.</p>

        <div>Variables can be thought of as storage containers for data in your code</div>
        <div>So in summary, there are two ways to declare a variable:</div>
        <ol>
            <li>let, which we can re-assign.</li>
            <li>const which we can't re-assign and will throw an error if we try.</li>
            <li>There is a third way which is <b>var</b> but we don't use that it's because it has other quirks that were cleared up when they introduced <b>let</b> and <b>const.</b></li>
        </ol>
